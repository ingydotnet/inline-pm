Revision history for Perl extension Inline::C.

0.53 Wed 1 May 2013
      Version 0.53 released to CPAN
      Add C/t/23validate.t test script.

0.52_02 Wed 24 Apr 2013
      Version 0.52_02 released to CPAN
      C.pm - Small tweak to setting of $o->{ILSM}{MAKEFILE}{INC} in validate() sub.
             Thanks, Ian Goodacre. (Ticket #11748.)

0.52_01 Thurs 11 Apr 2013
      Version 0.52_01 released to CPAN

0.52 Thurs 07 Mar 2013
      Version 0.52 released to CPAN.
      C-Cookbook.pod - Change the "Object Oriented Inline" example so that it doesn't
                       emit a "print (...) interpreted as function" warning if it's
                       run with warnings enabled.

0.51_03 Wed 28 Nov 2012
      Version-0.51_03 released to CPAN.
      C-Cookbook.pod - Add additional example ("Providing a pure perl alternative").
      C.pm - Change sub compile so that it chdirs back to the original cwd before
             it dies (if the build fails). (Ticket #81375.)

0.51_02 Tues 20 Nov 2012
      Version-0.51_02 released to CPAN.
      Makefile.PL - correct typo.

0.51_01 20 Nov 2012
      Version-0.51_01 released to CPAN.
      C.pm - setting $ENV{NO_INSANE_DIRNAMES} turns quote_space() into a no-op.
             (This is just an undocumented fallback option in case the quote_space()
             handling  of spaces breaks something for someone who has no need
             of "space handling" anyway.)
           - additional tweaks to quote_space sub [Ticket #81172]
      Makefile.PL - Set EU::MM PREREQ_PM to 6.62, but only if the current
                    version of EU::MM is 6.57_x, and even then only if
                    building with INSTALL_BASE. (Ticket #81094).

0.51 Sat 13 Oct 2012
      Version 0.51 released to CPAN.

0.50_03 Mon 8 Oct 2012
      Fix Reini's patch (#67053). The original version of quote_space()
      caused a breakage whenever the INC Config argument contained more
      than one -I switch. (See #80026.)
      Also, provide tests for this in the test suite.

      ../MANIFEST - Add new files.

0.50_02 Sun 18 Mar 2012
      C.pod - Rewrite CCFLAGS documentation to make it clear that setting
              it clobbers the existing CCFLAGS (which is $Config{ccflags}).
              Thanks, BrowserUk.
      ../Inline-FAQ.pod - Document the C/t/09parser.t test failure that
                          can occur when Cygwin is in need of 'rebaseall'
                          - and what to do about it. Thanks, davido.

0.43  Sun Jul 22 08:15:26 PDT 2001
	- Auto add script directory to INC path (-I)..

0.43  Sat Jul 21 12:38:37 PDT 2001
	- Added support for XSMODE.

0.43  Fri Jul 20 03:29:08 PDT 2001
	- Added OPTIMIZE config parameter for gdb debugging

0.43  Thu Jul 19 17:29:17 PDT 2001
	- Use $Config{dlext} instead of $Config{so}

0.43  Sat Jul  7 13:18:36 PDT 2001
	- Move the creation of a parser from parse() to get_parser(). This
	  allows Inline::CPP to override only get_parser(). (NEILW)

0.43  Sat Jul  7 12:53:33 PDT 2001
	- Break up the generation of XS code into smaller stages which can
	  be overridden in Inline::CPP. Makes the code somewhat longer, but
	  more clear. (NEILW)

	  structs.

0.42  Sun Jun 10 18:34:36 PDT 2001
	- Patch that prevents Inline from creating a nonexistent sitelib
	  Thanks Joey Hess.

0.40  Sat May 26 13:47:16 PDT 2001
	- Added hack to make work with Inline::Files and +w

0.40  Wed May 23 20:21:32 PDT 2001
	- 0.40 integration
	  Changed object references
	  Account for no trailing '/' in paths

0.34  Sun May  6 16:56:53 PDT 2001
	- Changed the generated Makefile.PL to not create any dependencies
	  between Makefile and Makefile.PL. This was creating a problem on
	  an HP-UX system using AFS. Inline users should never need this
	  dependency anyways.

0.34  Tue May  1 00:05:58 PDT 2001
	- Fixed compiler detection bugs in Makefile.PL

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001

	- Added support for Inline::Filters. FILTERS config option.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
	- Made installation of Inline::C optional. For those people without
	  a C compiler who may wish to use Java.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
	- Rearranged test harness. Moved all C tests from Inline to Inline::C

0.32  Mon Feb 26 15:36:56 PST 2001
	- Added MAKE config option
	- Changed LDFLAGS to proper name LDDLFLAGS. (MakeMaker)

0.32  Fri Feb 23 03:17:42 PST 2001

0.32  Fri Feb 23 03:16:27 PST 2001
	- Special case for AIX ($Config{so})

0.31  Thu Jan 18 22:02:17 PST 2001
	- Added the following configuration options: 'CC', 'LD', 'CCFLAGS, 'LDFLAGS'. These are proxies for the MakeMaker options of the same names.

0.31  Sat Jan 13 14:44:28 PST 2001
	- Allow relative paths in TYPEMAPS files.
	- Added a test 't/typemap.t' for this

0.31  Sat Jan 13 12:41:38 PST 2001
	- Changed over to new Inline DIRECTORY structure.

0.30  Fri Dec  8 01:55:43 PST 2000
