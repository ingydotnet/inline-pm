- |
  Inline.pm - in sub read_DATA() replace:
    @{$DATA{$pkg}} = split /(?m)(__\S+?__\n)/, $data
    with:
    @{$DATA{$pkg}} = split /(?m)^[ \t]{0,}(__\S+?__\n)/, $data;
    Otherwise some non-markers can be treated as markers.
    Thanks to Chris Nighswonger and Stefan Seifert.
    Added C/t/21read_DATA.t and C/t/22read_DATA_2.t as the test cases.
    NOTE: This is not a complete fix - it's still possible to
          write code (albeit in an unorthodox fashion) such
          that a non-marker can be treated as a marker.

date:    Fri Feb 5 2010

- Fix (in Inline.pm) problem regarding the calling of the same script from
  different builds of perl. (RT ticket 29326)
- Allow Inline::install() subroutine to apply to languages other than C and
  CPP. (RT ticket 35517)

  reports something like /some/place/cc. (RT ticket 8251)
- In C/C.pm, allow for the calling of multiple typemaps (RT ticket 5639), and

  which no bindings were found (RT ticket 17774).
- Minor doc fixes.
---
version: 0.44
date:    Mon Oct 28 10:31:51 PST 2002
changes:
- Doc fixes. Thanks Mitchell.
- Put all current ILSMs in doc and Makefile.PL
- Applied some patches from Patrick LeBoutillier, including one to make
  things work out of the box on Win95 and friends. Rob helped too.
- Added a warning to help debug why certain ILSMs might be failing.
- Changes to Inline-FAQ
- Fixed ParseRecDescent to handle 'unsigned foo()' and 'long foo()'
- Updated README
- Fixed %INC problem
- Used File::Spec::Unix for %INC keys (which are always in Unix form)
- Applied Mitchell's patch for Inline::C::ParseRegExp
- Updated pod docs
- Shortened BUILD_TIMER precision, per Leon Brocard's suggestion.
- Applied Mitchell Charity's patch to fix Piers Harding's CPP problem.
- Fixed bug with USING keyword
- Added the USING keyword. This allows you to specify a list of modules
  which can override certain parts of the Inline process.
- Added Inline::C::ParseRecDescent and Inline::C::ParseRegExp to
  provide two (hopefully) functionally identical C parsers. You use
  one of these by saying 'use Inline C => DATA => USING => "ParseRegExp"'.
  Big thanks to Mitchell Charity for ParseRegExp. It's over two orders
  of magnitude faster than ParseRecDescent.
- Added the more diagnostics to BUILD_NOISY.
- Added BUILD_TIMERS for benchmarking the Inline build process.
- Applied a (BIG) patch to the Inline distribution to use File::Spec
  to manipulate all file paths. Thanks Mitchell Charity!
- Fixed a bug in OS X. Inline::C was being required even if the object was
  cached. That's because Inline.pm wasn't checking for .bundle.
- Added an option to Inline::C called BUILD_NOISY. Setting this to
  true will cause the build process to dump output to the screen
  instead of to a file. You can set it with 'BUILD_NOISY => 1,' or
  'ENABLE => "BUILD_NOISY"'.
- Honor the PERL_INLINE_BUILD_NOISY environment variable, to do the
  same as above. Environment variable has higher precedence.
- Print the contents of 'out.make' to the screen on failure. This will
  happen when BUILD_NOISY is off. When its on, you'll see the messages
  in real time, but they won't go to 'out.make'.
- Provide the NOISY shortcut so you can say
  'perl -MInline=force,noisy foo.pl'.
- Inline::MakeMaker uses the NOISY shortcut for its build command.
  This way module builds are noisy like they should be.
- Integrated the new improved Inline::MakeMaker
- WriteInlineMakefile is deprecated for WriteMakefile
- Added a patch by Rafael Garcia-Suarez to use $^X when
  $Config::Config{perlpath} is wrong. (It happens)
- Refactored the Parse::RecDescent grammar
- Moved grammar module to Inline::C::recdescent
- Support 'const' in types. Requested by Nicholas Clark
- Other modifiers seemed to be busted. Like 'unsigned'. Got them working.
- Started integrating Mitchell Charity's parser. Don't know how to
  turn it on yet. It's currently in Inline::C::charity
- Allow C++ based modules to be installed as well as C ones. Requested
  by Piers Harding.
- Call validate() for interpreted ILSMs even on load(). This patch is
  dedicated to the very patient Mark Fowler who waited almost a year
  for it. I hope that never happens again.
---

  often come up in places I didn't anticipate.

---
version: 0.42
date:    Sun Jun 10 18:21:06 PDT 2001
changes:
- Re-fixed config generator path bug prevents ILSMs like I::Python
  and I::Tcl from installing. (NEILW)
---
version: 0.41
date:    Tue Jun  5 00:23:46 PDT 2001
changes:
- Don't install .inline or .inl files with Inline::MakeMaker.
  Require object name to be same as package name for installation.
  Put hack in INIT block to fix Sarathy's patch ;)
- Fixed config generator path bug that would prevent other ILSMs
  from installing. Thanks Patrick.
- Applied patch to (hopefully) handle CRLF variations properly.
  Thanks Binkley
---

  Fixed path bus for MacOS. Thanks Marcel.
  'with' works again (with Event)
  Inline::MakeMaker adds WriteMakefile dependency for Inline 0.40

- Croak on usage of SITE_INSTALL
- Update Inline.pod for 0.40 features
- Detect and croak on old config files
- TRIAL5 of Inline-0.40
- Added alpha support for Inline::Files
- Made all internal path names canonical
- Finished TRIAL1 version of Inline-0.40
- Short object names
- Safer config generation
- AUTONAME support
- Reinstituted AutoLoading
- Put all messages into subroutines inside Inline.pm
- Completely reorganized the Inline internal object into major groups
- API - Contract space for the ILSMs. Guaranteed backwards compatible
  after Inline 1.00.
- ILSM - Private space for ILSMs
- INLINE - Private Inline space. Subject to constant change.
- CONFIG - Config options. Not for use by ILSMs
- MATCH - Matching criteria for the object.
- STRUCT - Reserved for Inline::Struct
- Added command proxy logic for Inline::MakeMaker utilities
  INSTALL, MAKEDIST, MAKEPPD
- Got _INSTALL_ option working with Inline::MakeMaker
- Replaced Inline's use of Data::Dumper with Inline::Denter.
  This is a stripped down version of Data::Denter. This change
  makes Inline more secure because it doesn't need to eval()
  untrusted code. Also removes the dependency on Safe.pm which has
  known security flaws. Yay!

version: 0.25
date:    Fri Sep  1 10:07:33 PDT 2000
changes:
- Use MD5 on unmodified code only. User must force recompile if
  auto_headers change. This would have caused existing installs to break.
- Don't determine build path unless really needed, since a blib_I might
  be created. This might be annoying for someone who is only *using* an
  Inline extension module.
- Mangle $VERSION into object name for modules
- Support Inline->import(C=><DATA>); syntax
- Return an empty list when the C function is of type void and doesn't
  use any stack manipulating macros. (ie dXSARGS) It used to return
  whatever was passed in on the stack. :-(
- Force rebuild when SITE_INSTALL option is set.
- Figured out what was actually causing the 0.23 AutoLoader bug.
- Can't autoload from "./blib" (relative path) when chdir() has been
  used. Fixed properly now. Can AutoLoad fix_make() again. :-)
